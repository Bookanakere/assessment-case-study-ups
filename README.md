# assessment-case-study-ups

This repository contains the solution for the assessment based on case study for test automation. 

It mainly has three files

**1) bulk-upload.feature**: This file has the test scenarios for the bulk upload functionality. I used online specflow editor to write the scenarios in the Gherkin format. The assumptions based on which these scenarios have been written, are listed below

        a) Solution contains a single UI page where the user can upload the excel sheet
        b) The upload functionality page is not part of the existing pages and is a separate page
        c) The solution considers bulk upload of transport and delivery details. It does not consider upload of just the delivery details
        d) The solution considers bulk upload for multiple equipments based on the equipment number
        e) Bulk upload functionality supports .xls/.xlsx formats

 **2) assessment-draft-upload-template**: Draft template that the developers can use, to try the upload functionality
 
 **3) assessment-query-list**: This excel sheet contains the list of queries I have, regarding the bulk upload functionality and the solution.
